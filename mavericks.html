                    <p>Mavericks comes to life when long-period winter swells roll across the North Pacific and hit the shallow reef off Pillar Point. The unique underwater topography suddenly forces the swell upward, creating a steep, powerful peak that can double in size within seconds.</p>
                    <p>The reef acts as a natural amplifier, shaping a heavy right and a wider, slower left. When long-period energy meets light offshore winds, Mavericks produces one of the strongest and most dramatic waves on Earth — fast, deep, and demanding total commitment.</p>

                        <p>Jay Moriarity — Sixteen and Fearless
                        In the 1990s, Mavericks was a cold-water gladiator pit, surfed only by a handful of seasoned Northern California chargers. It was not where anyone expected to see a 16-year-old kid.</p>
                        <p>Jay Moriarity changed that.</p>
                        <p>On December 19, 1994, Jay paddled into a massive winter swell and launched himself down a wave that looked too big for his age, his size, or his experience. He hit a bump, fell from high on the face, and photographer Bob Barbour captured the exact moment he was suspended mid-air — a tiny silhouette against a giant, roaring wall of water.</p>
                        <p>Surfer Magazine put the shot on the cover instantly. It wasn't a photo of victory — it was a photo of courage. A teenager charging a wave most adults wouldn't paddle into, proving that Mavericks wasn't just for veterans. It was a place where pure heart and fearlessness mattered more than age.</p>
                        <p>Jay's wipeout became known as “The Iron Cross,” and instead of defining failure, it defined who he was: a young surfer willing to take on one of the heaviest waves on Earth.</p>
